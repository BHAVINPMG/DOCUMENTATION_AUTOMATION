# 🎬 Demo Walkthrough

A well-structured demo can make APM's value tangible for IT-ITES customers. Here's a comprehensive guide:

## Pre-Demo Checklist
- **Set Up Sample Applications**: Before the demo, configure APM agents on a couple of applications that will be interesting to show. For example, one custom web application (to illustrate transaction tracing), and another microservice or API (to show distributed tracing). Ensure these are actively monitored and have performance data in APM.
- **Test Data Ready**: If possible, introduce a controlled performance issue to demonstrate (e.g., simulate slow database queries, high memory usage, or network latency). This will make the demo realistic and highlight problem detection capabilities. Alternatively, use historical data from a past incident to show real-world troubleshooting.
- **Dashboards & Access**: Have the Motadata AIOps UI logged in and navigate to the APM module or dashboard. Ensure the audience can also see any correlated views (infrastructure monitoring, logs, alerts console) if you plan to show integration points.
- **Narrative Planned**: Know the storyline – for instance, "Client reports slow application performance – let's use APM to find out why" – and have that scenario ready to walk through with real business context.

## Suggested Demo Data/Scenario
- **Synthetic Application for Demo**: Create a synthetic monitoring scenario using a demo application (if available) or use a known historical event. For example, "Last week we had a performance issue with our client's e-commerce application – let me show you how we diagnosed it with APM's transaction tracing." Alternatively, demonstrate with a live application showing real user traffic patterns.
- **In-Platform Context**: Make sure to demonstrate how APM is accessible in the unified platform – for instance, show that from a central NOC dashboard, an alert can drill-down into an APM view. This ties the feature into daily operations and shows the power of integrated observability.

## Key Demo Highlights to Emphasize

1. **Transaction Flow Visualization**: Show a complete user transaction from frontend to database with detailed timing breakdown. Explain, "See how this user request flows through our application stack – here's the web server (50ms), then the application server (200ms), and finally the database (150ms). APM immediately shows us where time is being spent." This visual representation is compelling and answers "where are the bottlenecks?" – it's instantly visible.

2. **Real User Experience Timeline**: Utilize the historical slider or time picker to show user experience changes. For example, "Now, let's rewind to this morning... notice the response time was much better (green). You can literally see how performance degraded over time." If there was a deployment or configuration change, point that out: "At 2 PM, we deployed new code – see how response times increased. APM captured that change." This shows off the Historical Performance Playback and proves APM is not just a static tool, but a time machine for application performance.

3. **Error Detection and Alerting**: If possible, trigger an alert in real-time or show a pre-recorded alert. Walk through how an APM alert appears: "Here's an alert we got – 'High error rate on Payment Service (Critical)'. Clicking it takes us to the APM view and it's pinpointing the problem in the transaction flow." Show the audience how you'd then drill in, maybe by clicking the problematic method to get details (like stack trace, database queries, external calls). This drives home that proactive, intelligent alerts are part of the solution – not just passive monitoring.

4. **Code-Level Performance Analysis**: Demonstrate deep-dive into application code performance. Show slow method identification, database query analysis, and optimization recommendations. For example, "This method is taking 80% of the transaction time – here's the exact line of code and the database query causing the delay. APM provides specific optimization recommendations." This shows the technical depth and actionable insights that separate APM from basic monitoring.

5. **Integration Points**: Mention or show that APM is part of the unified platform. For example, demonstrate cross-launch: "From this application performance issue, I can pivot to see infrastructure metrics or related logs" to show the power of having APM within Motadata vs. a standalone tool. Show how application performance correlates with server CPU, memory, or network metrics.

6. **Use Case Tie-back**: End the demo segment by tying what you showed to a real business use case. For example, "In a real scenario, what we just saw could mean the difference between a 2-hour client outage and a 10-minute performance issue – because with APM, we identified the database query was the bottleneck and optimized it immediately, maintaining client satisfaction and SLA compliance."

## Demo Pro Tips
- Start with the application overview dashboard to show comprehensive visibility across all monitored applications
- Use transaction tracing to demonstrate detailed performance analysis and bottleneck identification
- Show real user monitoring data specific to Indian market conditions and geographic diversity
- Highlight the unified platform integration with infrastructure monitoring and log analysis
