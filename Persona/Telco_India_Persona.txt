Buyer Persona – VP of Network Operations / CTO at a Telecom Operator (India)

Persona Type: Buyer
Job Roles and Titles: Vice President of Network Operations, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of a telecom company, or Head of Network Engineering at a major Telecom Service Provider (mobile/internet operator).
Key Responsibilities: Overseeing the performance and expansion of the telecom network (cellular networks, fiber backbone, data centers). Responsible for ensuring high QoS (Quality of Service) for millions of subscribers, managing network capacity upgrades (e.g., rolling out 5G, fiber) and maintaining regulatory compliance with telecom authorities. This persona also manages large NOCs and engineering teams, and controls the budget for network infrastructure and tools. They set strategy for network reliability, customer experience, and cost-efficient operations.
Business Goals and Challenges: Key goals include delivering near 99.999% network availability, reducing dropped calls and slow data issues, and maximizing ROI on expensive network investments. They are pushing to modernize with SDN/NFV, 5G rollouts, and cloud-native cores, but face challenges integrating these with existing legacy telecom equipment. A huge challenge is visibility across a very complex, distributed network – from tower base stations to cloud services – especially as networks virtualize and generate massive telemetry. They are also concerned with customer churn if network experiences degrade, so they aim to be proactive in identifying issues. Meeting regulatory requirements (like TRAI rules in India for call quality, or lawful interception logs) adds burden. Cost control is vital too: after investing billions in spectrum and infrastructure, they need to optimize operations to maintain margins.
Pain Points (Monitoring & Observability): Traditional network monitoring tools are siloed (mobile RAN monitoring separate from core network, separate from IT systems). This persona struggles with fragmented visibility, making it hard to pinpoint root causes of outages or performance dips that span across network domains. For example, a customer’s poor call quality might originate in the packet core, but siloed tools cause finger-pointing between teams. They lack real-time unified insight, so outages sometimes are discovered from customer complaints rather than proactive alerts. Network observability gaps mean they can’t easily correlate metrics like jitter, packet loss, or cell tower load with end-user experience in real time. Security is also a concern – without integrated log and flow monitoring, detecting anomalies (like DDoS or network intrusions) is slower. Another pain point is tool sprawl: large telcos may have 8–10 different monitoring systems; this complexity drives up costs and training needs.
Key Buying Motivations and Criteria: The buyer is motivated to adopt full-stack observability to optimize and safeguard the network. They want a platform that provides real-time, end-to-end visibility across the telecom stack – from network devices (routers, base stations) to virtual network functions, cloud infrastructure, and even customer-facing apps – in a single pane. Performance analytics are crucial: the ability to detect and preempt outages or degradations (e.g., spotting a failing router card or congested link before it causes downtime). They also prioritize scalability – the system must handle millions of metrics and flows without choking. Integration with telecom protocols (SNMP, telemetry streaming, 5G-specific metrics) and support for Network Flow Monitoring and NetRoute (routing protocol) monitoring is key to manage traffic engineering. Automation is a big criterion: they look for AIOps features that can automatically correlate events and possibly trigger self-healing (important as networks grow too large for manual management). Cost-wise, while budget is significant, they will measure value by reduction in outages (which can save huge revenue) and operational efficiency gains. Regulatory compliance features (audit trails, data retention) are also on their checklist.
Preferred Communication and Engagement Channels: This persona stays informed via industry bodies and reports (e.g. GSMA intelligence, TRAI whitepapers) and attends telecom industry events (like India Mobile Congress). They network with other CTOs and share best practices. They often engage vendors through RFP processes but are receptive to executive briefings, technical workshops, and case studies showing improvements in telco KPIs. Communication is formal; initial contact via email/LinkedIn followed by on-site presentations or demos is common. They may also consume thought leadership content from global sources (Telecom magazines, webinars on 5G and observability). A local touch is important – they appreciate when a vendor’s telecom experts (possibly an engineer from the vendor who understands Indian telecom challenges like rural connectivity issues or regulatory environment) communicate with them directly.
Decision-Making Influence and Authority: As a VP or CTO, this persona has significant authority over technology procurements. They typically set the requirements and lead the selection of an observability platform, often as part of a larger transformation initiative. However, in large telcos, final decisions might involve procurement committees or C-level consensus (especially if it’s a multi-million dollar deal). This persona’s recommendation is usually decisive, as they have the technical vision and P&L responsibility for network operations. They also need to ensure buy-in from their network operations teams (who will use the tool) and possibly the CIO if IT and network operations are separate. They often frame the decision in terms of business impact – e.g., how observability will reduce outages and improve customer satisfaction (and thus revenue). Their sign-off is critical, and they act as the executive sponsor for implementation.

User Persona – NOC Engineer/Network Operations Lead (India)

Persona Type: User
Job Roles and Titles: Network Operations Center (NOC) Engineer, Network Performance Manager, or Senior OSS (Operations Support Systems) Engineer at a telecom provider. They might supervise shift teams in the NOC or be a domain expert (e.g., specializing in radio network performance or core network analytics).
Key Responsibilities: 24/7 monitoring of the telecom network, including cell sites, transmission links, core network elements (MSC, SGSN, etc.), and supporting IT infrastructure. They respond to alerts indicating network issues (tower down, fiber cut, bandwidth congestion, etc.), troubleshoot incidents, and escalate to field teams if physical intervention is needed. They also produce daily network health reports, track key KPIs (downtime, latency, call drop rates), and fine-tune alarm thresholds. A senior NOC user may also be responsible for managing network configuration compliance – ensuring devices are running approved software and configurations (critical in telecom to avoid outages from misconfigurations).
Business Goals and Challenges: The primary goal is to maintain uninterrupted network service and meet SLAs for uptime and performance. They strive to quickly detect and resolve issues before customers are impacted. A significant challenge is the volume of data – modern telecom networks generate enormous logs, metrics, and traces; sifting through this manually or with basic tools is overwhelming. They also deal with a wide variety of technologies (legacy 3G/4G equipment alongside new 5G gear, physical and virtual network functions) – monitoring each often requires different tools or expertise, which complicates their workflow. During major outages or peak events, the pressure is intense, and the existing tools might flood them with alerts without clear prioritization. Additionally, performing root cause analysis can be very tricky (e.g., is a dropped-call surge due to a radio issue, a backhaul link issue, or a core software bug?). They often work in shifts, and knowledge transfer between shifts is crucial – if the tools lack good dashboards or historical context, things get missed.
Pain Points (Monitoring & Observability): Current OSS/NMS (Network Management Systems) might only provide siloed views – e.g., a radio network alarm console separate from an IP network monitor – forcing the NOC engineer to toggle between screens. Limited correlation means when a site goes down, they see alarms for multiple systems (site power, transmission, etc.) but the system doesn’t automatically correlate them to one root cause (say a power failure), so they waste time. False alarms or flapping alerts are frequent, leading to alarm fatigue. They also lack deep insights into network flows; for instance, identifying a sudden spike in traffic on a router requires jumping into a separate NetFlow analyzer, which not everyone is trained on. Without unified log monitoring, they might miss subtle security incidents (like unusual login attempts on network equipment). When changes are made (new configuration rollouts), they worry that compliance drifts could cause issues, but tracking config changes across thousands of devices manually or in spreadsheets is error-prone.
Key Buying Motivations and Criteria: From the user’s perspective, a unified observability platform promises to greatly simplify their operations. They want a single console that can show them the status of the entire network and IT systems, with the ability to drill down. Correlation and AI-driven insights are highly appealing – e.g., if a fiber cut occurs, the tool should automatically relate the dozens of alarms and pinpoint “this fiber link break is likely causing these 50 cell sites to go down,” saving them analysis time. They need robust Network Flow Monitoring to troubleshoot bandwidth and quality issues, and NetRoute monitoring to see routing changes or BGP issues in real-time (which is critical when rerouting traffic during outages). They also value an integrated Log Monitoring that can ingest network device logs and highlight anomalies (for example, a sudden reboot log from a router). Support for Infrastructure Monitoring of the telco cloud (servers, VMs, containers running virtual network functions) is now important as telcos move to cloud-native 5G cores. The platform should be highly reliable and support geo-redundancy (NOC engineers can’t afford their monitoring tool to go down). Customizable alerts (so they can tune it to reduce noise) and good visualization (maps of network topology with real-time status) are plus points.
Preferred Communication and Engagement Channels: This persona often learns about new tools through internal evaluations or vendor workshops. They read technical blogs (including those by vendors like Cisco, Nokia, etc.), join telecom tech forums, and perhaps follow specialized groups (e.g., an online community for network engineers). They appreciate training sessions or certifications offered by observability vendors. When engaging with vendor content, they prefer practical guides (“how to monitor 5G network slices,” etc.) and success stories from other telecom NOCs. Many in India’s tech community are active on LinkedIn; they might watch short explainer videos or attend webinars (especially if there’s a Q&A with an expert). They also rely on peer discussions – maybe through alumni networks or colleagues at other operators – to gauge which tools are effective.
Decision-Making Influence and Authority: The NOC engineers provide critical input in the decision process. They might not decide the budget, but their evaluation during a pilot can confirm if a solution truly works in the live network. Often, management will have them score vendors on criteria like usability, feature coverage, etc. Their hands-on experience means they can uncover pitfalls (or highlight strengths) that executives wouldn’t see. A respected NOC manager’s endorsement can sway the CTO’s decision, as it signals the tool will be embraced by the team. Conversely, if the NOC team finds a tool cumbersome or inadequate, they can push back and cause the buyer to reconsider. Therefore, this persona indirectly holds a lot of power; they are also the ones who will ensure the tool is actually utilized post-purchase, which gives their voice weight in choosing something user-friendly and effective.

(Current telecom customers likely mirror these personas – e.g., Indian telcos already grappling with multi-tool environments and seeking unification – while ideal future prospects include newer or growing operators in India who are planning their 5G and fiber expansions and want a modern observability approach from the start.)
