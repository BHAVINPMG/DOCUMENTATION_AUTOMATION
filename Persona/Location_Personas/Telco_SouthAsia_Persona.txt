Buyer Persona – Head of Network Operations/CTO at Regional Telecom (SE Asia)

Persona Type: Buyer
Job Roles and Titles: Regional CTO, General Manager of Network Operations, or Head of OSS/BSS at a Southeast Asian telecommunications company. This could be at a major mobile operator spanning several Southeast Asian countries or a prominent national carrier in one country (e.g., Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand).
Key Responsibilities: Ensuring reliable telecom services (mobile, broadband, enterprise connectivity) across diverse geographies. Overseeing the rollout of new technologies (fiber to rural areas, 5G in cities, perhaps 5G standalone core) while maintaining legacy 2G/3G networks where needed. They handle cross-border network integration if the company operates in multiple countries, and manage large operations teams. They interact with government regulators in multiple jurisdictions for compliance and quality benchmarks. Budget-wise, they allocate funds for network expansion and tools and need to justify these investments to corporate leadership (which might be headquartered in Singapore or another hub).
Business Goals and Challenges: A critical goal is improving customer experience in markets that are highly competitive – reducing dropped calls, improving data speeds, and differentiating with reliability. They also aim to reduce operational costs by leveraging automation, since manual operations don’t scale well across thousands of islands (in Indonesia) or remote provinces. Challenges include geographical complexity (e.g., monitoring undersea cables in archipelagos, or maintaining consistent service during monsoon seasons affecting infrastructure). Talent and skill levels may vary – some countries have cutting-edge expertise, others rely more on vendor support – so they need tools that can bridge skill gaps with intelligence. They face tool fragmentation especially if operations in each country historically chose different systems; unifying observability is both a technical and organizational challenge. Meeting local regulations (like data sovereignty or lawful intercept logging) adds to requirements. Moreover, the rapid subscriber growth in some SE Asian markets means they must plan capacity and preempt issues or face public backlash and government penalties for outages.
Pain Points (Monitoring & Observability): This persona deals with heterogeneous environments – different equipment vendors across regions (Huawei/Nokia for radio, Cisco/Juniper for IP, etc.), making unified monitoring hard. They suffer from “too many monitoring tools” syndrome, with each domain (RAN, transport, core, IT) using separate systems that don’t talk to each other. This leads to slow incident resolution and inefficiencies. For example, when internet service is slow in one country, it might take hours to determine if it’s a submarine cable issue versus a DNS server issue because of disjointed tools. There’s also lack of real-time analytics – current systems might not handle the volume to do real-time anomaly detection across all network layers. As a result, outages or degradations are sometimes caught late. In some cases, language and localization of tools can be a problem (if a tool’s interface isn’t fully localized, training staff whose first language isn’t English can be slower). Ensuring consistent configuration and compliance across multi-country networks is painful without a unified compliance monitoring tool – misconfigurations have caused outages, and they want to avoid repeats.
Key Buying Motivations and Criteria: This buyer is motivated to find an observability platform that can standardize network monitoring across all operations – creating a centralized “NEROC” (network operations center) that has a bird’s-eye view of the entire regional network. They look for strong multi-tenant or partitioning capabilities (so teams in each country can see their domain, while HQ can see everything). Key criteria include support for massive scale and data integration – the platform must integrate with varied data sources (SNMP traps, streaming telemetry, cloud APIs, etc.) and present them cohesively. They prioritize analytics and AI: given scarce expert manpower, they want AI-driven insights to catch things humans might miss. Network Flow and traffic analysis is important to manage cross-border bandwidth and peering links efficiently. They also need robust APM and service-level monitoring for any digital services (some telcos also offer digital apps, IPTV, mobile banking – those need APM to ensure service quality). The solution should have flexible deployment (cloud or on-prem) to meet any data sovereignty rules. Cost-wise, they are willing to invest for a solution that can replace multiple existing tools (consolidation will justify cost). Vendor track record and support in the region is considered – they favor providers that understand telco needs and have local partners for support/training.
Preferred Communication and Engagement Channels: This persona often engages via a formal RFI/RFP process but is influenced ahead of time by vendor presentations at industry events (e.g., CommunicAsia, regional Telecom summits). They read case studies of other telcos (especially if a competitor or renowned operator in another country implemented something successfully). They might consult industry analysts or telecom consultants. Direct engagement typically involves on-site workshops where the vendor demonstrates capabilities on the telco’s own data (proof of value). They appreciate when global best practices are combined with local context in communication. Given multiple stakeholders (operations, IT, security), they sometimes prefer multi-department meetings with vendors to see how the tool serves all needs. They are reachable via email/LinkedIn for high-level info, but expect thorough proposals and documentation as discussions progress.
Decision-Making Influence and Authority: As a high-level operations head or CTO, they drive the requirements and likely have the final say on technical suitability. However, final purchase might need CEO or board approval if it’s a very large expenditure, especially in semi-government telcos. They must also consider feedback from country-level GMs or operations heads; a misalignment could stall the project. Thus, while they hold strong authority, they often build consensus among national teams. They are the sponsor who will be accountable for success, so they make sure the chosen solution has buy-in from NOC teams and IT teams. If the organization is part of a group (e.g., Axiata or Singtel group companies), they might also coordinate with group-level IT for alignment. In summary, this persona is the chief influencer and decision-maker, navigating both upwards (securing budget approval) and sideways (getting operational consensus) to finalize the decision.

User Persona – Regional NOC Team Lead / Telecom Systems Engineer (SE Asia)

Persona Type: User
Job Roles and Titles: NOC Team Lead, Senior Network Engineer, or OSS Specialist working in a telecom operations center in Southeast Asia. Possibly an individual who oversees shift engineers or is the go-to expert for network monitoring tools and processes.
Key Responsibilities: Monitoring the telecom network and services across possibly multiple regions, coordinating with local NOCs or field teams. They manage the alarm triage process, ensure that major incidents are addressed promptly, and often serve as the link between local technical teams and the central operations. They also handle the configuration of monitoring tools – setting thresholds appropriate for each region (accounting for local network differences), creating dashboards for different layers (transport vs radio), and training junior NOC engineers. Part of their job is to continuously improve the monitoring setup, e.g., reducing noise, adding new coverage for new network elements as the network evolves.
Business Goals and Challenges: Their goal is to maintain a harmonized, high-efficiency operations center. They want to reduce mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to repair (MTTR) issues across the board. A big challenge is operational consistency – different sites or countries might have slightly different procedures or tools, and the lead is trying to unify these for clarity. They also face the challenge of scale: during peak hours or big events (like a national holiday where mobile usage spikes), the volume of alerts and data can skyrocket, testing the limits of their current systems. Another challenge is ensuring less experienced staff correctly interpret and act on alerts; the lead often has to build safeguards or knowledge into the monitoring system (like clear alert descriptions, runbooks linked to alarms). They may struggle with incomplete monitoring – for example, some new cloud-based service introduced by corporate might not be well-integrated into their old monitoring, creating blind spots that worry them. Cross-domain incidents (like a slight increase in latency causing an OTT streaming issue) are hard to diagnose with current tools, which frustrates the team when pressure is on.
Pain Points (Monitoring & Observability): They likely deal with alert overload and lack of intelligent filtering. Many alerts might be irrelevant or duplicates, but manually adjusting thresholds across a vast network is laborious – current tools might not support smart adaptive alerting. Investigating issues often means manually correlating data: one screen shows CPU high on a core router, another shows an anomaly in user traffic, and they mentally connect the dots. This is error-prone, especially under time pressure at 3 AM. In multi-country ops, latency or time sync issues between monitoring systems can confuse incident timelines (“Did the outage in site A cause the issue in site B, or are they unrelated?”). They also lack holistic service views – they monitor infrastructure, but not always the service experience. For example, they might not know a problem exists until customer care reports a surge in complaints because their tools didn’t directly measure the user experience. Compliance and audit tasks – proving that all network changes were monitored or that security logs were reviewed – become pain points if they have to extract data from separate systems and consolidate reports manually.
Key Buying Motivations and Criteria: From the user lead’s perspective, an observability platform that can correlate across domains and reduce noise is a game-changer. They are very motivated by features like event correlation/AIOps that would automatically suppress symptomatic alarms and highlight the root cause, which is especially crucial in a multi-layer network event. End-to-end service monitoring is another desire – the ability to trace a customer transaction through the network (like a voice call’s path or a data session trace) in real-time to identify where it’s failing. They’ll evaluate the platform’s support for telecom-specific metrics (e.g., Radio signal quality metrics, call drop counters, etc.) and how easy it is to customize. Multi-language support or intuitive UI is important if their team is international. They also want robust log and config management integration: the ability to see config changes (from a network config compliance module) and logs in the same place as performance metrics, to quickly see if a change caused an incident. Scalability and reliability of the tool are key criteria they’ll test – can it handle millions of events per minute, does it have high availability. Finally, they look for good role-based access control since different teams (NOC vs engineering vs security) might use it – they want to ensure each sees what they need.
Preferred Communication and Engagement Channels: This persona likely participates in technical evaluations extensively. They might join workshops with vendors and ask very detailed questions or request trial access. They read manuals, admin guides, and release notes to see if the product meets their needs. In terms of getting info, they could be in telecom engineering forums or WhatsApp/Telegram groups with peers across the region. They value vendor-run training sessions or even certifications (because they’ll be the one to master the tool and teach others). Online, they might follow network engineering blogs or case studies on sites like Telecommunication journals or APMdigest. They may not be super active on broad social media for work, but they do network at technical meetups or via LinkedIn with others who have deployed similar systems. They often reach out directly to vendor technical contacts (sales engineers, etc.) for specific concerns during evaluation.
Decision-Making Influence and Authority: This team lead has strong influence on the decision, as they will be the one integrating and using the platform daily. Senior leadership will heavily weigh their feedback from any pilot. If they can demonstrate in a trial that the observability platform catches an issue that the old tools missed – that’s a powerful endorsement. Conversely, if the tool is hard to use or didn’t fit one of their critical use cases, they can raise red flags that may eliminate that option. They often present their assessment to the decision committee. While they don’t sign off on budget, they might be asked to quantify how the new platform will help (e.g., “we can potentially reduce outage resolution time by 50%”). After purchase, they’ll likely lead implementation, so decision-makers know they must be comfortable with the choice. In summary, their practical thumbs-up or down is a deciding factor in which observability solution is chosen, making them a key internal advocate or critic during the buying process.

(These telecom personas cover both existing scenarios – many SE Asian telcos currently juggling multiple tools and needing unification – and target prospects who are modernizing. For instance, a current user might have some basic network monitoring and feel the pain of its limits, whereas an ideal prospect envisions a fully integrated observability approach to manage their growing 5G networks.)
