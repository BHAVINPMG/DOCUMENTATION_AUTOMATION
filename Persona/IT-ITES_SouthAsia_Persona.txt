Buyer Persona: CTO / IT Director (IT & Software SME)
Job Roles/Titles: Similar to India – CTO, Head of IT, or Product Engineering Director in a tech startup, software company, or IT service provider across Southeast Asian countries (e.g. Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia).
Key Responsibilities: Overseeing the technology infrastructure and product delivery. In more mature markets (like Singapore), this persona focuses on cloud strategy, reliability engineering, and ensuring the tech platform can scale regionally. In developing SEA markets, they may also handle more basic IT management due to smaller teams. They are responsible for compliance with any local data laws and ensuring service availability to end-users or clients.
Business Goals: Drive digital innovation and high uptime as the company expands across the region. Often aims to adopt best-in-class practices (many look to global standards) – for example, implementing full CI/CD and cloud-native architectures to stay competitive. Goals include improving operational efficiency (perhaps by reducing on-prem in favor of cloud, where appropriate) and meeting customer expectations for always-on services.
Challenges: Diversity of markets – they might oversee IT across multiple countries, each with its own regulatory and infrastructure nuances. Integration of systems acquired or used in different branches can be problematic. In some Southeast Asian SMEs, budget constraints and limited skilled manpower pose challenges similar to other regions. Additionally, language and localization can be a factor (ensuring tools and processes work for non-English-speaking staff in countries like Thailand or Vietnam).
Pain Points (Observability): They struggle with siloed monitoring tools inherited from various sources – e.g. one tool used in the Singapore HQ, another in the Vietnam office – leading to inconsistent views of performance. Ensuring compliance across geographies (like data sovereignty rules in Indonesia or Malaysia) adds complexity; for example, certain data must stay in-country, so the monitoring solution must adapt to that (likely favoring on-prem deployments in each locale). As the company grows, their current monitoring doesn’t scale well, resulting in slow response to incidents or even undetected issues.
Key Buying Motivations & Criteria: A unified observability platform that can be standardized across all offices in the region is highly attractive – it brings consistency and easier management. They want multi-lingual support (for documentation or UI) and strong vendor support in the region (local presence or partners for quick assistance). Cost-effectiveness remains important, but they are also looking at cloud compatibility – for instance, some may prefer a solution that can be deployed in their private cloud or on local cloud providers common in SEA. Interoperability with widely-used technologies (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes) is expected. In more advanced locales, they might specifically seek advanced APM capabilities to monitor user experience of their applications.
Preferred Communication Channels: This persona consumes content in English but also sometimes in local languages depending on country. They follow global tech trends via sites like Tech in Asia, and attend regional tech conferences (e.g. Cloud Expo Asia in Singapore). Webinars by known tech vendors and local IT community events are popular. Relationship-based selling can be effective – references from industry peers in Southeast Asia or case studies (e.g. how a similar company in Malaysia used Motadata) resonate strongly.
Decision Influence/Authority: They typically have authority to approve solutions up to a certain budget. In startups, the CTO might be the final decision maker; in mid-size IT service firms, they may need CEO or CFO sign-off, but their word is key. They often pilot a solution in one location and if successful, roll it out region-wide, so they consider not just initial purchase but the longer-term partnership with the vendor.

User Persona: DevOps Engineer / IT Administrator
Job Roles/Titles: DevOps Engineer, Cloud Operations Engineer, or IT Systems Administrator working in a tech company or MSP in Southeast Asia. In smaller setups, this could be a “jack-of-all-trades” IT engineer managing both development pipelines and operational monitoring.
Key Responsibilities: Day-to-day management of systems and responding to any outages or performance issues. They set up monitoring for new services (e.g. when deploying a new microservice or onboarding a new client’s infrastructure). They also handle routine maintenance (patching, backups) and support developers by providing infrastructure metrics. In MSP contexts, they are on call for client incidents and maintain monitoring configurations for each client environment.
Business Goals: Ensure smooth operations with minimal downtime for all services in their care. They aim to shorten deployment-to-production time (through automation) without sacrificing reliability. Knowledge sharing and skill growth are personal goals as well, given the fast-evolving tech landscape.
Challenges: In many SEA countries, IT teams are lean – one engineer might manage what a larger team handles elsewhere. This overextension means time is scarce for proactive improvement; they are often firefighting. They also have to handle a mix of cutting-edge tech (cloud, containers) and some legacy elements (perhaps a customer still using on-prem VMs), which complicates monitoring setups. Internet connectivity can be an issue in some locations (outside of city centers), making remote monitoring more challenging (they need solutions tolerant to occasional network issues).
Pain Points (Observability): Overwhelming alert noise is a common pain – without fine-tuning, they receive too many alerts from various systems and risk missing critical ones. They also lack a unified view: for example, if a client’s database is slow, they might not easily see if it’s a network issue or a spike in user traffic without manually checking logs and metrics across tools. Setting up monitoring for each new project or client is time-consuming if not automated. In some cases, they have to operate within bandwidth constraints – heavy monitoring data might saturate networks – so they worry about the overhead of the observability solution itself.
Key Buying Motivations & Criteria: They value solutions that simplify their workflow – e.g. easy setup (pre-configured templates, auto-discovery of devices) and centralized management of multiple environments. Automation is key: features like auto-remediation (scripts triggered by alerts) or integration with configuration management (Chef/Ansible/etc.) add appeal. Because they deal with cloud services, APIs and integration capabilities of the monitoring tool are important (so they can script and integrate into their toolchain). Lightweight operation is considered – a solution that can function in low-bandwidth scenarios or with remote sites offline (store and forward data when reconnected) is a plus in some Southeast Asian contexts.
Preferred Communication Channels: They engage in regional tech communities – for example, the Singapore DevOps Meetup, or online groups for AWS Users in Indonesia, etc. They often watch YouTube for technical tutorials (including content in local languages). Documentation and how-to guides on the vendor’s site are crucial for them (they will RTFM!). Many in this persona also use WhatsApp/Telegram groups with peers to share knowledge.
Decision Influence/Authority: They provide critical input to the buying process by testing the product and demonstrating its value to their bosses. If the tool doesn’t meet their needs or is too hard to use, they will voice that, potentially vetoing a purchase. Their practical evaluation carries a lot of weight. In some cases (especially at startups), they might directly make purchasing decisions for smaller tools or subscriptions if within an allowed budget, but strategic platform decisions usually involve the buyer persona’s approval.
