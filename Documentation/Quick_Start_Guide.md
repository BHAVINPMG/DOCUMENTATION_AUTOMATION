# Quick Start Guide for Documentation Automation

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### 1. Choose Your Persona Combination
Simply tell me:
- **What feature** you want to document (e.g., "APM", "NetRoute", "NCM")
- **What industry** you're targeting (e.g., "BFSI", "Healthcare", "Education")
- **What region** you're focusing on (e.g., "India", "MiddleEast", "SouthAsia")

### 2. Specify Document Types
Tell me what documents you need:
- **Sales Enablement Kit** (Primary focus - fully automated)
- Case Study (Future expansion)
- Solution Brief (Future expansion)
- ROI Calculator (Future expansion)
- Implementation Guide (Future expansion)
- Or any combination of these

### 3. I'll Generate Everything
I'll automatically:
- Read and analyze both persona files
- Follow the exact rules for Sales Enablement Kits
- Create targeted, customized content
- Address industry-specific challenges
- Include regional considerations
- Generate all requested documents

## 📋 Example Requests

### Simple Request:
