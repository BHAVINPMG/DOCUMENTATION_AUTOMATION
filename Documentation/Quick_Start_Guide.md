# Quick Start Guide for Documentation Automation

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### 1. Choose Your Persona Combination
Simply tell me:
- **What feature** you want to document (e.g., "APM", "NetRoute", "NCM")
- **What industry** you're targeting (e.g., "BFSI", "Healthcare", "Education")
- **What region** you're focusing on (e.g., "India", "MiddleEast", "SouthAsia")

### 2. Specify Document Types
Tell me what documents you need:
- Sales Enablement Kit
- Case Study
- Solution Brief
- ROI Calculator
- Implementation Guide
- Or any combination of these

### 3. I'll Generate Everything
I'll automatically:
- Read and analyze both persona files
- Combine the insights
- Create targeted, customized content
- Address industry-specific challenges
- Include regional considerations
- Generate all requested documents

## 📋 Example Requests
